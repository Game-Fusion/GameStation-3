# GameStation 3

### Live in your world, play in ours.

The GameStation 3 was created sometime between late 2016 and early 2017 as a successor to the famous GameStation 2. However, due to development complications - the source code was lost for an extended period of time shortly before release - it never truly saw the light of the marketplace. However, this is changing in 2018. The GameStation 3 has been cleaned up and for the first time ever, we are encouraging development for the GameStation 3. In fact, we're making a big step; we're allowing anyone and everyone to update the OS!

### Development

Any user can create their own modified version of the GameStation 3 system software, as well as being invited to create their own programs for the GS3. This is a brilliant opportunity for users to tinker with the software like never permitted before and to truly create their own experience. However, this also opens up the opportunity for malicious software, and this is indeed a security risk. This is why we strongly recommend sand-boxing the update beforehand, and/or running it on a separate machine by booting the boot.elf update file. We will create an ever-expanding list of officially approved modifications to the GameStation 3 on this GitHub page to let users know what software is approved by us as safe, and we will also be posting the source code to these modifications on this GitHub. We want GameStation 3 to not just become a viable platform for the end user, but also to become a developer-friendly platform which encourages experimentation, creativity and unleashing your vision for what you want your GS3 to be. If your update has code that may be beneficial to the main codebase, we may even add it!

We hope people take advantage of this fantastic opportunity and do great things with the GameStation 3!
